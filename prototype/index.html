    <h2>The Mission</h2>

      <p>The rocket carrying Gordo into space would take off from the <strong>Atlantic Missile Range at Cape Canaveral</strong>, travel further than <em>any monkey had ever 
      travelled</em> before - over 1,500 miles - and reach a height of 310 miles (500 km) before returning to Earth and landing in the South Atlantic, 
      1,302 nautical miles south of Cape Canaveral.</p>
      <blockquote>"We all heard the rumors that they want to send a monkey up first. Well, none of us wants to think that they're gonna send a 
      monkey up to do a man's work ... what they're trying to do to us is send a man up to do a monkey's work."<cite>Deke Slayton, Mercury Seven Astronaut</cite></blockquote>

    <h3>The Jupiter AM-13</h3>

      <p>The Jupiter IRBM (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile) was originally developed by the <strong>US Army as a long-range successor to its PGM-11 Redstone missile</strong>, 
        but was eventually taken over and deployed by the USAF for political reasons. It was also the only one of the 
        United States' early stategic ballistic missiles with some mobility.</p>

    <h3>The Journey</h3> 
      <p>Gordo wore a specially customised space suit custom made for a <strong>monkey</strong> about one foot tall. The space suit was fitted with instruments, 
        including temperature meters and microphones which recorded his historic suborbital journey, considered one of the outstanding achievements of space research.</p>

    <h4>Gordo's Daily Routine</h4>
        <p>Gordo was a very important Monkey making his daily routine very important. The Scientist who were in charge of him made a specific routine just for him to keep 
          him healthy and happy. On an average day Gordo would do all the following in this order</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Wake up</li>
          <li>Eat</li>
          <li>Excercise</li>
          <li>Do experiments</li>
          <li>Relax and Eat</li>
          <li>Sleep</li>
        </ol>
    <h5>Gordo's Experiments</h5>
        <p>While in space Gordo was assigned simple experiments. Here is a list of a few of them.</p> 
        <dl>
          <dt>Testing if he had similar brain and physical functions while in space</dt>
        
          <dd>Ring Excercise</dd>
          <dd>Putting all the rings in the right spot from large to small while only moving one ring at a time</dd>
          
           <dt>Reaction time and memorization test</dt>
        
          <dd>Picture Test</dd>
          <dd>He would have to memorize the pattern of certain picutres that would blink and press them in the same order</dd>
          <dd>Each turn gaining one more picture to press</dd>
        </dl> 
    <h5>Gordo's Diet</h5>
        <p>During Gordo's Journey he was supposed to ration his food, however, it did not turn out this way. He somehow got access to all of his food 
          before he was supposed to and ended up eating all of it.</p>

    <h3>Gordo's Return</h3>
        <P>Gordo returned back to earth safely. The entire world had mixed feelings of happiness and surprise as they were seeing a monkey that weighed 10 pounds 
          more than when he started. This is a quote from Gordo when he returned: <q>hoo hoo hah ooh ha</q><cite>Gordo the Space Monkey</cite><p>
