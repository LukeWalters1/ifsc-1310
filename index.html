        <h3>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h3>
        <p>After showing my project to my dad, he was very impressed that I was able to make something like this after only 1 semester of Computer Science. 
          He didn't really say anything that he thought I could improve on, but I knew that I had to get my pictures working. So after talking to him I decided to get my pictures working on the site.
          Overall this assignment was very fun, I got to combine all the strategies and other stuff we learned throughout this semester into my project, and I think it turned out pretty good, for this being my first time taking a Comp Sci class. 
        </p>
        <p>My entire life I have been very curious about how websites work. I have been pressing inspect element and page source on random websites for as long as I can remember, and I was always baffled that someone was able to put all these words together and make an interactive website out of it. 
          In particular, this class was very fun for me, because I felt like every week I would have an aha moment when I learned something that I have been staring at my entire life not knowing what they meant. The first aha moment I can remember was when
          we learned about using #footer in a link to instantly take you to the bottom of the page. I used this when creating a link on the bottom of the page that would take you back to the top. Another thing that found very fun in this class, was the use of photoshop. I have been an avid user of photoshop over the past few years, for personal and business reasons,
          so I have become quite good at it. Before coming into this class, I had no idea that photo shop was used when creating websites, but looking back now it makes a lot of sense, since your goal is to have a website that runs effieciently. A photo that has been altered to take less space and use less resources would obviously only help this.
        </p>
        <p>For this assignment, I learned quite a lot about altering css so that It wouldn't affect other pages or other parts of the same page. This was the main issue I had when creating this website. I would constantly have to alter my css or html just that it would stop getting affected by the new css I was writing. After finishing the project I now realize that this could have been solved with better planning at the beginning with classes and names or better specified css. 
          I also struggled with margins and spacing in some of my footers and aside element stuff. I had to go back to the flexbox froggy assignment multiple times to help me remember how to deal with these issues.
        </p>
        <p>All in all, I had a lot of fun this semester, I really enjoyed some of the stuff we did in this class, I don't know if it has to convinced to me focus on this area of computer science though. I think I might want to learn about game design and computer science to do with art, since I have been toying with these my entire life. 
          I will definitely keep in mind the stuff we learned this semester, and if I don't enjoy game design or another field of computer science I might just come back to this one.

        <h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
        <p>Progressive Enhancement is a content-first method of designing websites, so that users with older 
           browsers can still make sense of the website, while users with newer browsers get an optimized, fully featured experience. 
           It is important because there are still many people in the world that don't have a computer able to run newer browsers, 
           and they can't just be left out to dry. With Progressive Enhancement everyone, no matter their hardware, is able to access
           the content centric website and find the information they are searching for. The website I used for more information 
           is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement</a>.</p>
